# MemAssist

> Optimize your algorithms in terms of data locality

**MemAssist** is a compiler assisted dynamic code analysis tool that supports the
optimization of application code in C or MATLAB. It is used to indicate source code refactorings/optimizations that may improve
temporal locality and reduce cache misses on the targeted architecture cache(s).
The tool has been primarily deployed as an extension for the Visual Studio IDE
but is now offered as a web application for hands on evaluation.

MemAssist Can be accessed here: [https://memassist.lezos.gr](https://memassist.lezos.gr)

A detailed documentation of the tool will soon be available.
